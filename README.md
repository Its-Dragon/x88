# x88Cheats Menu

A side project of recreating the x88Cheats Menu in LUA for Primordial, which will include a framework for auto adding new variables. I'm not sure if a project like this exists already but I don't think it does, and as far as I know, I am the only one attempting this. Although it is very simple, hopefully someone will learn from it. It will also likely have a recode when it gets too messy though I will try to keep it as clean as I can. Credits will be given in the code by comments for anyone curious of what specific functions are from the help of who.

Features:
- x88Cheats Menu
- Framework (TODO)
- Custom ESP (TODO)
- Controlled by keys (TODO)
